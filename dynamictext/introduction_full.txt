I am a lifelong computer enthusiast who enjoys creative problem solving and is used to high-pressure environments. I am eager to leverage a unique blend of technical expertise and soft skills honed in the prehospital environment into a dynamic tech role, while continuously expanding knowledge and expertise in the field.<br><br>

While studying it was clear I am particularly interested in the software development environment and computer science. I found learning C++ enormously rewarding. My main Software Development Project was to design and build an 8-bit microcontroller simulator to be used as an educational tool, enabling learners to visualise and explore the intricacies of low-level programming and memory management within a microcontroller environment. I found this project to be a particularly enjoyable highlight of the degree.<br><br>

I have held a life long fascination with computers, having grown up in the era of the BBC Micro and the Amiga, but followed my calling to be a Paramedic for the London Ambulance Service for the past 20 years. One of my main professional highlights would have to be working for London's Air Ambulance as a Flight Paramedic for over three years. An amazing and rewarding experience.<br><br>

I have kept coding (although my BBC Basic is very rusty) and before studying for my MSc I was particularly interested in writing creative projects in Javascript using the p5.js library (from the the amazing Processing.org). Digging my old broken Amiga out of the attic a few years back and teaching myself some basic electronics, so as to be able to fix it, reignited my passion for learning in this field and kickstarted this change in career.<br><br>

As a recent graduate, and coming from a different career, I am very open to roles that will expand my knowledge and push my learning. I take with me the many 'softer' skills gained from working in dynamic and high pressure situations. Continual development, team work, and compassion were an essential part of the many roles I took on in the Ambulance Service and I'm looking forward to bringing those skills to a new workplace.<br><br>
