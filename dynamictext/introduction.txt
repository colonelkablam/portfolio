I am a recent Software Engineering MSc graduate with distinction from the University of Westminster, transitioning from a rewarding 20-year career as a paramedic, pursuing a passion for software development. Although I'm yet to find a language I do not enjoy learning, I am particularly interested in lower-level languages, graphics, computer architecture, and games and educational application development.
