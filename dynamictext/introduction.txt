I am a recent Software Engineering MSc graduate with distinction from the University of Westminster, transitioning from a rewarding 20-year career as a Paramedic with the London Ambulance Service, pursuing a passion for software development. I am particularly interested in lower-level programming, graphics, and C++ (although I'm yet to find a language I do not enjoy learning)
